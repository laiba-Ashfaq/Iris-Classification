# Iris-Classification
This project uses machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbors) to classify iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species based on petal and sepal measurements. It includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and optional visualizations like confusion matrix and pairplot.
